Il circuito descritto si occupa di leggere e rielaborare i dati da RAM producendo un'immagine con nitidezza più alta e quindi più leggibile. 
Quando il segnale start è fornito al circuito, viene attivata la prima macchina a stati ed in base al bias tra la saturazione dei pixel e l'offset ovvero il valore minimo di saturazione, viene restituita nei valori di memoria immediatamente successivi un'immagine che meglio ricopre la gamma di colore rappresentabile.
Quando la elaborazione è terminata, viene restituito un segnale di done ed il circuito è pronto per una nuova immagine a partire dall'indirizzo 0.

Nel circuito è stato scelto di dividere in 3 la computazione con moduli in cascata.

\section{Architettura}

Authors are encouraged to send electronic media as their submission. Although we prefer that papers be submitted as Wolfram Mathematica notebooks, we can process papers from a variety of other formats, such as LaTeX. Papers prepared using other formatting systems or submitted in hard copy only may have to be retyped, causing delays in processing. This sample paper was prepared with Wolfram Mathematica and can be used as a template. It is available for download at \url{www.complex-systems.com/contribute.html}. A LaTeX version is also available.

\section{Risultati sperimentali}

Figures are an excellent mechanism for communicating many kinds of results. Great care should be taken to produce clear, well-constructed figures.When there are many related graphs or images, they should usually be combined into a single figure. 

Figures should be displayed near where they are first mentioned in the text and are numbered sequentially: Figure \ref{ex-fig} is an example. All figures and tables should be mentioned in the text.

It is best to send your figures in a {``}scalable{''} form such as Wolfram Mathematica Graphics Objects, Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) or PortableDocument Format (PDF). Figures can also be processed in {``}bitmap{''} formats such as BMP, PICT or TIFF, but scalable formats generally reproduce better.
%\begin{figure}
%\centerline{\epsffile{Teemo_19.eps}}
%\caption{An example figure. The first sentence of a figure caption should serve as a title for the figure. The remainder should describe the figure in a way that does not rely on the main text of the paper. Readers may look at the figures and their captions before reading
%the full text.}
%\label{ex-fig}
%\end{figure}
 
Figures should reproduce well (i.e., without noticeable aliasing) on common printers. The source file for a particular figure must include all elements of the figure and should not require modification. Lettering should be consistent throughout a figure and must be no smaller than 6 points when the figure is at final size. Lines should be thick enough that they do not break up under reduction (single-pixel lines rarely suffice). Filled black areas must not drop out. Whenever possible, the figures should be oriented in the same sense as text (portrait mode). 
Computer programs or algorithm descriptions may be given either in equations or in figures. Literal expressions that occur as computer input or output should be given in typewriter font. 
Tables should include captions similar to those for figures and should be numbered sequentially throughout the paper: Table \ref{ex-table} is an example. Tables must be oriented with the text and use 9-point type, and should be enclosed by a box.

\section{Simulazioni}
\label{main-text}
Risultati  dei  test  fatti  e  le ragioni di tali test -motivare le scelte
\begin{itemize}
\item Bisogna considerare che \(log (delta +1)\) risulta caso limite nel momento in cui il valore di Milano delta assume valore \(2^{n}-1\) (con \(0<=n<=8\)). La LUT dell'implementazione, tiene già conto dell'argomento del logaritmo, cambiando quindi il valore ogni volta che viene raggiunto dal delta una potenza di 2.  
\item Il delta sarà nullo nel momento in cui tutti i valori dell'immagine saranno uguali. Sarà infatti MAXPixel=MINPixel, generando così uno \(shiftlevel=8\) (caso massimo) che porterà quindi ad avere in output solo valori nulli. Questo è anche intuitivamente immaginabile con una monocromia dell'immagine che quindi viene riportata al valore di default.
\item Il delta sarà massimo nel momento in cui \(MAXPixel = 255\) e \(MINPixel = 0\). Il valore del logaritmo è quindi massimo e lo \(shiftlevel=0\) (caso minimo) che porterà quindi ad avere in output gli stessi valori di input.
\item Lo Shift sinistro di n posizioni equivale a moltiplicare \(Value*2^{n}\). Un caso importante da considerare è quando il valore di \(n=8\) : il valore di \(Current Pixel-MINPixel\) verrà quindi completamente portato a sinistra lasciando tutti zeri, rispetto alla rappresentazione di 8 bit del pixel. Perciò il valore di \(Temp Pixel>255\) e si avrà quindi un output di valori massimi.

% Numbered lists of items are obtained with \begin{enumerate} ... \end{enumerate}
If a list of items is given in the text, such as: (\textit{a}) first item; (\textit{b})~second item; and so forth, they should be indicated with parenthesized letters in italic typeface.
\section{Risultati di sintesi}
Consistent mathematical notation is essential to clear exposition. Try to use familiar notation; for example, avoid having \(x\)stand for an integer index.
All standard mathematical symbols and notations must be formatted in equation form, whether inline or displayed. Even standard English letters such as x must appear as \(x\) (mathematical font) if they correspond to mathematical symbols. Use roman for abbreviations in equations, for example,\(\sin (x)\).
% In LaTeX, such in-line equations are delimited by \(...\).
%
% For a full list of TeX symbols, see the LaTeX or TeX manuals.
% Boldface is obtained with \textbf{...}
% Roman (ordinary) font, often used for English words within equations,
% is obtained with \textrm{...} (note that spaces between words must be
% indicated explicitly).
Displayed equations that are referenced in the text should be numbered sequentially: 
% This is done automatically if the correct tags are used in LaTeX. 
\begin{equation}
e^{2\pi i}=1.
\label{exponential-equation}
\end{equation}
% Any text can be used in a \label to mark an equation. Usually it will 
% be a tag that relates to the content of the equation. 
Spaces should be inserted in equations where necessary to improve readability. Equations should be referred to as {``}equation (\ref{exponential-equation}).{''} Short equations may be inserted directly in the text, as in \(\beta =2\). Equations that involve extensive subscripts, superscripts or built-up objects should be displayed. Special symbols in equations must be strictly limited to those that can be produced with Wolfram Mathematica using common fonts.
If a formatting system other than Wolfram Mathematica or LaTeX is used, make sure that all symbols are very clearly identified, and that all subscripts and superscripts are evident. \textit{Complex Systems} allows many kinds of notation. It is suggested that symbols or words related to actual or theoretical computers be indicated in \texttt{typewriter font}. 
Great care should be taken in mixing plain English, mathematics and algorithm descriptions. Say, for example, {``}\(x\) is the position{''} rather than {``}\(x=\) position.{''} Consistency must be maintained between different occurrences of a symbol. If \(x\) is a mathematical symbol, make sure it appears as \(x\) everywhere, not sometimes as x or as \texttt{x}. As a rough guide, mathematical symbols should appear as \(x\) and computer symbols as \texttt{x}. 
\begin{theorem}
Theorems and other structured mathematical text should be used when it improves the presentation. They should not be a substitute for clear English exposition. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Proofs can continue for several paragraphs. They should end with an empty square.
\end{proof}
\section{Conclusioni}
\section{About the References}
References should give pointers to background material and related work. They should record credit due to other authors. 
References are numbered sequentially throughout the text. 
% This is achieved automatically using \cite in LaTeX.
Each item should be given a separate number (except when citations are made to different portions of the same document: these should be indicated as {``}\cite[pp. 3--56]{text-a}{''} or {``}\cite[Chapter 14]{text-b}{''}). 
\textit{Full titles of papers should be given}. They should be enclosed in quotation marks, with all important words capitalized. Titles of printed items should be followed by a comma inside the quotation marks. Include the paper{'}s digital object identifier (DOI) name (number) if it is available(\url{www.doi.org/hb.html}). Titles accessible only via the internet are treated differently based on their type. See the examples described in the References section of this sample paper.
To cater to a wide variety of disciplines, it is important that \textit{all names of journals be spelled out in full} and italicized. (Use \textit{Physical ReviewLetters}, not\textit{ Phys. Rev. Lett.}, and \textit{Journal of Computer and System Science}, not \textit{J. Comput. Sys. Sci.}) 
For printed items, give the journal{'}s volume number in boldface (do not write the word {``}volume{''} explicitly). The issue number should be placed in parentheses immediately following the volume number, but not in bold: for example, \textbf{4}(1). Include months only when necessary, using their three-letter abbreviation. Give starting and ending page numbers.
Author names should be given with initials first, with spaces after each period. For sources that list more than 10 authors, the names of the first seven authors should be given, followed by {``}et al.{''} For sources with fewer than 10 authors, all names are listed.
Titles of books (i.e., published material with ISBN numbers) should be italicized. Names and cities of publishers and dates of publication should always be given. Conference proceedings that are distributed through ordinary publishers should be cited like books. 
Titles of proceedings and reports that are distributed in other ways or via the internet should be given in full in the standard roman typeface.URLs or other information on how to obtain them should be given following the title. Pricing information should not be included.
